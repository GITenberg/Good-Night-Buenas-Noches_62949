<h2>I</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Scarlet</span> fuchsias on a swaying
branch freckled the &rsquo;dobe wall
behind Loretta&rsquo;s perch. The parrot,
her claws wide apart, her brilliant
rudder tilting to balance her
gray body, industriously snapped
at the blossoms. One secured
at last, she turned slowly about
and, with infinite care, let it drop
upon the open pages of Padre
Alonzo&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>The padre brushed the flower
away and glanced up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenos días, señor!</i>&rdquo; clacked
Loretta; &ldquo;<i>buenos días! buenos días!
buenos días!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day to thyself,&rdquo; retorted
the padre. He spoke in Spanish,
shaking a stout finger. &ldquo;And tear
not the flowers again. They be the
last of the kind till after the New
Year. So take warning, I say, lest
thou find thyself thrust without the
garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loretta recognized displeasure in
his voice. She mumbled an inquiring
&ldquo;<i>Ga-a-wk! ga-a-wk!</i>&rdquo; and
shifted thoughtfully from foot to
foot. But, presently, the padre
having resumed his reading, she
turned once more to catch at the
swaying branch.</p>

<p>When a second fuchsia came
fluttering down to his hand, Padre
Alonzo uncrossed his sandals and
rose. &ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; he cried,
wagging his close-cropped head so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>vigorously that the very beads of
his rosary tinkled together. &ldquo;Thou
art the naughtiest bird in all of
California! What if Padre Anzar
finds thee despoiling his plant?
He will put thee again where thou
must fight to keep thy feathers&mdash;in
the kitchen with the cats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the mention of cats a startling
change came over the parrot. Her
plumage ruffled, her eyes began to
roll, she straightened on the perch,
uttering hoarse cries of fear and
defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then be good,&rdquo; he counselled,
&ldquo;be good. Or off thou&rsquo;lt likely
go. Me-e-ow! me-e-ow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now Loretta moved nearer,
anxious for friendly terms. &ldquo;<i>Dame
la mano</i>,&rdquo; she suggested; &ldquo;<i>a-a-aw,
dame la mano! A-a-aw! a-a-aw!</i>&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>She balanced tremblingly on one
leg, curling the other under her.</p>

<p>Padre Alonzo put the stout finger
into the proffered claw. &ldquo;So, so,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;And I shall not tattle.
But tell me: What would make
thee forget to use thy sharp pruning
shears? An apple? or seeds? or
one of Gabrielda&rsquo;s sweet bis&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loretta perked her head to one
side. &ldquo;<i>To-o-ny, To-o-ny, To-o-ny</i>,&rdquo;
she droned coaxingly.</p>

<p>The padre thrust his thumbs
under the white cord of his girdle
and broke into a guffaw. &ldquo;Thou
jade!&rdquo; he teased. &ldquo;Wilt have
Tony, eh? Well, I go to find
him.&rdquo; He gathered in his brown
cassock, preparatory to stepping
over the cacti here bordering the
garden path. &ldquo;But look you, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>he comes, scrape not the gilt from
the wires of his pretty cage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another threatening shake of the
finger, and the padre crossed the
low, spiked hedge and waddled
away through the sun.</p>

<p>When he came into sight a moment
later round the dun wall of
the mission, he carried a canary at
his shoulder. &ldquo;E-oo, e-oo,&rdquo; he
cooed, pattering forward. &ldquo;Loretta
wishes thy company. Sst!
sst! She is bad after thee, Tony!
But be wary, little one, be wary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The advice was wholly ignored.
For, spying the parrot, Tony was
instantly transformed from a silent,
dumpy ball of yellow to a slim, dapper
songster with a swelling throat.</p>

<p>Loretta greeted him with uproarious
laughter, and a jargon of Span<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ish,
patois, but triumphant. She
paced the horizontal piece that gave
her perch the form of a cross. She
<i>pu-r-red</i> and <i>gu-r-red</i>. She swung
by her curved beak and one leathery
foot, shrilling her &ldquo;<i>Buenos
días, señor!</i>&rdquo; Then, as the padre
hung the cage to a nail in the trellis
built against the wall, she changed
her performance to the clamorous
repeating of a mass.</p>

<p>Padre Alonzo was shocked.
&ldquo;Sst! sst!&rdquo; he chided; &ldquo;thou
wicked big-ears!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noon angelus was ringing.
He caught up book and gown.
But before going he pulled at Loretta&rsquo;s
gaudy tail, not unkindly, and
chuckled as she edged toward Tony
with many a naïve and fetching
cock of her gray head.</p></div>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">High</span> at the garden&rsquo;s centre,
nailed to a massive tree of wood,
stood out the Sacrifice. From behind,
fir and pine thrust their long
green boughs, as if eager to screen
that torn and unclad shape. From
below, jasmine and geranium, carnation
and rose, sent upward an
unfailing incense.</p>

<p>That way, in the heat of mid-afternoon,
came Padre Anzar.
Thin-lipped he was, and hollow-eyed.
In one hand he held a
trowel, in the other a knife. Down
the front of his brown cassock,
mingling at knee height with red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>brick-stains from the chapel floor,
were touches of fresh earth. Anzar
the priest was for the moment Anzar
the gardener.</p>

<p>He walked slowly, here stooping
to right a stalk or jerk a weed,
there stretching to pick a fading
orange leaf from where it marred
the glaucous sheen of its fellows.
Fronting the figure, he paused long
enough to whisper a prayer and
make the holy sign. Then he rambled
on, busy with trowel and
blade.</p>

<p>But presently he came to a full
and startled halt. He was beside
the trellis up which climbed his
treasured fuchsia. The cross-like
perch of the parrot was beyond the
bordering cacti, and unoccupied.
Near by, upon its nail, hung the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>canary cage, with Tony going up
stairs and down untiringly, eying
his visitor with no uneasiness,
greeting him, on the contrary,
with saucy chirps. While underneath,
spotting the ground in
some profusion, and cast as it
were at the feet of the garden&rsquo;s
singer, were scores of scarlet
blossoms!</p>

<p>The padre&rsquo;s look travelled from
the scattered flowers to the vacant
perch, from the perch to the naked
branches swaying against the trellis,
from the branches to the wide,
warm top of the &rsquo;dobe wall. And
there was Loretta, patrolling in unconcealed
apprehension.</p>

<p>The instant he caught sight of
her he knew her guilt. He pursed
his thin lips. Then, letting fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>trowel and knife, he straddled the
hedge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wring thy neck for thee!&rdquo;
he vowed.</p>

<p>A sandal in the trellis, a light
spring, and his head came even
with her. She backed away, raising
her wings a little, and <i>gawking</i>
in protest. He took a fresh
grip on the wall, reached out and
caught her like a chicken&mdash;by
both legs.</p>

<p>Wild screeches rang through the
garden, screeches that put the sparrows
to flight and set the canary
cheeping in fear. These were
punctuated next by raucous appeals
for &ldquo;<i>Tony</i>&rdquo; or gurgley parrot
language.</p>

<p>The padre was down now, and
standing on the path again. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>he was not fulfilling his threat.
Instead, he was viewing his captive
angrily, yet in considerable indecision.</p>

<p>Loretta, on the other hand, was
at no loss for a course of action.
Between cries for the canary, demands
for a handshake, and reiterated
&ldquo;<i>Good-days</i>,&rdquo; she was
vigorously trying her beak upon
the padre&rsquo;s fist.</p>

<p>But now a new factor upon the
scene. Round the mission wall,
waddling fast and propelling himself
by his swinging arms, appeared
Padre Alonzo. &ldquo;Is&rsquo;t the cats?&rdquo;
he asked as he came on; &ldquo;oh, la!
la! is&rsquo;t the cats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padre Anzar half turned, scowling.
For answer, he only pointed
to the severed fuchsias.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>The other looked, covering any
regret with simulated astonishment.
&ldquo;These were dropping of themselves
yesterday,&rdquo; he began between
breaths. &ldquo;They&mdash;they
fell fast in the night&mdash;eh?&rdquo; He
came beside the other now, partly
to support the suspended Loretta
in his hands. &ldquo;I saw them&mdash;truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; And Padre Anzar gave
Loretta such a shake that she tumbled,
squawking and sputtering,
from the other&rsquo;s hands, and again
hung, heels above head, like a
chicken caught for the block.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did but what the wind
hadst done,&rdquo; faltered Padre Alonzo.
&ldquo;Sst! sst!&rdquo; (This to the parrot.)
&ldquo;Such language from a lady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah-<i>ha</i>!&rdquo; grunted Padre Anzar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&ldquo;I <i>told</i> thee not to buy a bird that
was raised in a garrison town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>To-o-ny! To-o-ny!</i>&rdquo; pleaded
the parrot. &ldquo;<i>A-aw, To-o-ny!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on solemnly,
addressing her, &ldquo;and thou art of
the devil, and hast as many tricks.
Twice I forgave thee&mdash;once for
shouting &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; on St. John&rsquo;s
Day, as the censer passed; again,
for pulling the feathers out of
Señor Esteban&rsquo;s choice hen. But
thou wilt not escape now. Now
thou&rsquo;lt go to the kitchen and be
shut in with Gabrielda&rsquo;s black
mouser. There thou shalt shed
some quills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this dire threat, he departed
along the path, Loretta still hanging
head down at his knee.</p>

<p>Scarcely a moment later a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>motion
sounded from the distance,
a commotion muffled by &rsquo;dobe wall.
First came the voice of old Gabrielda,
then the clatter of an over-turning
pan, next the terror-stricken
shrieks of Loretta. Presently,
Padre Anzar appeared, his jaw set,
his eyes shining with the look of
duty done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will be nicely scared this
time,&rdquo; he told Padre Alonzo.
&ldquo;She will match her busy peak
with Tomasso&rsquo;s claws, and she will
remember hereafter to let my blossoms
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; began Padre Alonzo,
deprecatingly, &ldquo;perhaps &rsquo;twere as
well to take her out of temptation&rsquo;s
way, to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padre Anzar raised his shoulders,
strode over to knife and trowel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>caught them up. &ldquo;Move her as
thou wilt,&rdquo; he said grumpily, &ldquo;and
the farther the better. Tony is
proper for us, pretty and songful.
But that parrot,&rdquo;&mdash;he shook his
tools as if they were Loretta&mdash;&ldquo;how
altogether useless and ugly
and noisy and blasphemous and
good-for-naught!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this he departed into the
shrubbery.</p>

<p>Sounds were still coming from
the kitchen&mdash;Gabrielda&rsquo;s cracked
voice, Loretta&rsquo;s cries, the sullen
yowling of a cat. Nodding sadly,
Padre Alonzo waddled to the
perch, vacant and formed like a
cross. This he lifted and bore to
a place along the wall opposite
the great crucifix, where climbed
no flowers. Then, smiling gently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>as if with some tender thought,
he waddled back to the trellis,
took the cage from its nail, and,
returning to the perch, hung Tony
close beside.</p></div>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 29-31]</a></span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Late</span> that night, on coming out
of the chapel, Padre Alonzo discovered
a little black something blocking
his way along the moonlit path.
As he paused, leaning forward to
peer, the black something sidled
nearer him, and saluted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenas noches!</i>&rdquo; it said, its
voice monotonous and human with
grief and weariness; &ldquo;<i>buenas
noches! buenas noches!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The padre bent lower and lifted
the parrot to the level of his face.
&ldquo;Aye, good-night truly, as thou
sayest,&rdquo; he repeated proudly.
&ldquo;Thou hast some wicked words of
a garrison town, but thou knowest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>the difference between sun and
moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Aw, Lora</i>,&rdquo; murmured the parrot;
&ldquo;<i>aw, Lo-ra! Lo-ra!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tomasso has used thee
badly.&rdquo; Padre Alonzo patted her
head. &ldquo;I shall put thee on thy
perch,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;though I
trust good Anzar will not know it.
But the moon is up, and my heart
is tender. Alas! one does many
things when the moon is up. And
the next day&mdash;one does penance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thrust the parrot into a fold
of his cassock, made along to where
was the perch, and placed her upon
it. Then he stood back, folding
his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow is Christmas Day,
Loretta,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And what
wilt thou give to Tony? What can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>the cactus give the golden poppy?
Thou hast only love, eh? Well,
that is much, though it grows from
naught, as a China lily blooms from
a bowl of rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned, and found himself
before the Tree. Fir and pine
massed their branches behind it,
making a background of plushy
green. Against that background,
showing full, hung the torn and
unclad shape. The moon glinted
upon it, haloing the head of the
Crucified.</p>

<p>The padre sank, bowing, and
touched himself in the sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Aw, To-o-ny! To-o-ny!</i>&rdquo; came
a sleepy croak at his back. The
parrot was settling herself for the
night.</p>

<p>Padre Alonzo rose and turned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>reaching up to stroke her. &ldquo;Good-night,
Loretta,&rdquo; he said fondly.
&ldquo;There were none too lowly for
His gift of love. It was spared to
thee, a yawping fowl, a talker after
the manner of the lazy Mexicans
that bred thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned back upon the path,
sighing and raising his eyes once
more. &ldquo;But for high or low,&rdquo; he
said, musing aloud, &ldquo;the fruit of
that love is sacrifice.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 35-37]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Out</span> of the chapel came the
sounds of the noon service&mdash;the
level intoning of prayer, the rumble
and swell of the padres&rsquo; voices.
From her place before the great
crucifix Loretta mocked it, only
ceasing now and then to answer
Tony&rsquo;s warbles with little whistles
of delight, or to run her open bill
up and down the bit of vertical pole
dividing her perch. Yesterday&rsquo;s
bout in the kitchen, yesterday&rsquo;s
hunger and fear, the lonely night
ramble along the path, the lack of
her preening friend&mdash;all these
were forgotten in to-day&rsquo;s safety,
sunlight, plenty, and companionship.
And so she <i>gurred</i> and
<i>purred</i>, <i>a-a-awed</i> and <i>ga-a-wked</i>,
shrilled her &ldquo;<i>Buenos días!</i>&rdquo; across
the garden, laughed uproariously,
or droned the familiar mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>In reach of her pacing, in touch
of her very tail, was the gilded cage,
with Tony darting up stairs and
down, yet sparing time now and
then for a sip or a seed or a saucy
chirp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo3"><img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="400" height="522" alt="Advancing by soft steps came Tomasso the cat"
title=""  /></a></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>But of a sudden the happy cries
of both birds were changed to notes
of alarm. The canary, its round
eyes starting like two polished
shots, fluttered high and low, beating
its yellow wings against the
wires; while Loretta squared her
rudder, spread her pinions and
squatted belligerently. For on the
ground, advancing that way by soft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>steps, and with the gloating look
of the hunter fixed upon the cage,
came Tomasso, the cat.</p>

<p>Quickly the parrot rallied from
her panic. As if she knew that her
arch-enemy was not seeking her
now, but the precious bit of fluff
at her side, she began a series
of terror-inspiring performances
learned in the profane garrison
town of her hatching; she gave
tongue to dire words that had long
since gone out of her repertory.
Ruffled to twice her size, she
strutted along her perch, shrieking
angry orders to mount, flinging out
&ldquo;<i>Vuelta! vuelta! vuelta!</i>&rdquo; in husky
trooper tones, and whistling the
bugle calls.</p>

<p>It failed to scare Tomasso.
Within the cage, as it gently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>danced from its spring, was a
tempting morsel, one that lured all
the more through its effort to
escape. The cat crept steadily forward,
velvet foot following velvet
foot, across the shifting dapple
before the great crucifix, across the
packed gravel of the garden path, to
the near shade of a gold of Ophir.
There, under the roses, he paused,
amber eyes glowing, whetted claws
slipping in and out expectantly,
muscles rolling and flexing with
the measurement of the leap.</p>

<p>Then, with the cunning of the
wild mother, Loretta adopted new
tactics, seeking to divert him. She
wobbled upon her perch, giving
vent to bursts of hysterical laughter;
she got between him and the
cage and railed at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>His unblinking eyes did not leave
his quarry, his muscles kept their
quiver of preparation. At the end
of his sleek body, touching the
path, his long tail swept, to and
fro, to and fro, to and fro, like a
furry pendulum marking off the
dread time.</p>

<p>By now other inmates of the
garden were alarmed. A blue jay
scolded from the terra-cotta roof of
the chapel. From the cross-piece of
the tree a line of sparrows gave over
their squabbling to look down.</p>

<p>Loretta&rsquo;s excitement grew wilder.
Out of her beak poured phrases not
of mass or military, not of good-days
or&mdash;nights. For under the
gold of Ophir the furry pendulum
was standing out straight and the
moving muscles down Tomasso&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>length were tight and still. Her
instinct knew the signs, and again
and again she quavered out the
&ldquo;<i>Fuego!</i>&rdquo; that had disgraced St.
John&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<p>No one heard. From the chapel
still sounded the intoning of prayer,
broken by the rumble and swell of
the padres&rsquo; voices.</p>

<p>A moment, and she acted. With
a &ldquo;<i>Ga-a-wk!</i>&rdquo; of defiance, she
aimed her flight for the ground,
took it in all but a somersault, and
landed herself directly before the
astonished Tomasso. Then once
again she spread her wings and
squared her rudder, making ready
for a clash.</p>

<p>Tomasso&rsquo;s eyes fell to her, he
relaxed, body and tail, spitting resentfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>Quickly emboldened, she came a
hand&rsquo;s breadth nearer him, snapping
at the black tip of his nose.</p>

<p>He retreated to his haunches, but
directed a swift cuff her way.</p>

<p>To this she responded with hoarse
laughter and yells of &ldquo;<i>To-o-ny!</i>&rdquo;
as if she summoned the canary to
witness the encouraging progress
of the fight. Then she stalked forward
once more.</p>

<p>Tomasso wrinkled his face.
Their positions were unpleasantly
reversed. In Gabrielda&rsquo;s domain
it was she who backed off or sought
the safe places, and he who sallied
out from his cozy nook by the
range to scare her into noisy protests.
While here she was bristling
to him. His paw poised itself in
mid-air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Loretta grew reckless. Fanning
her wings, in one lightning stroke
she bit him between his flattened
ears.</p>

<p>The pain of it enraged Tomasso.
With a jump, he met her.</p>

<p class="bgap">Then ensued such a scene as the
kitchen knew. There was mewing
and spitting and yowling; there
was <i>gawking</i> and squalling and a
rending cry for &ldquo;<i>Tony!</i>&rdquo; All the
while, close to the gold of Ophir,
the cat and the parrot went dizzily
around and around, a whirligig of
gray, scarlet, and black&mdash;that tossed
off fur and feathers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 608px;">
<a id="illo4"><img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="608" height="400" alt="Fanning her wings in one lightning stroke"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="gap">It was over in a moment, when
Tomasso fled, over path and grass,
and into a dusky recess between
the trunks of fir and pine. There
he lay down, sulking and grum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>bling
and licking his paws. But
Loretta stayed where she was a
little, holding her head sidewise in
the attitude of a listener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Lora</i>,&rdquo; she murmured presently,
her voice inquiring, &ldquo;<i>Lora,
Lora</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, slowly and clumsily, she
made her way to the base of the
perch, and with beak and talons
climbed it.</p></div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46-49]</a></span></p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was past the noon angelus
when Padre Alonzo came waddling
along the path, and he found the
garden still&mdash;still, and filled with
the sun-drawn incense of trees and
flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sst! sst! Tony will be too
warm, I fear,&rdquo; he was saying aloud
as he neared the cage. &ldquo;The little
one shall go to a cooler spot.&rdquo;
And with this conclusion, he halted
beside the perch of the parrot and
lifted the chirping canary down to
his knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buenos días,&rdquo; he said to Loretta,
pausing a moment; &ldquo;a good
day, truly, but over-hot, so that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>cassock makes of me a living olla,
for I am beaded with water drops
from top to toe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The parrot shifted a little, and
again set her head sidewise, as if
she were puzzled and listening.
Next, she edged toward him, and
uncertainly, putting a foot down,
clasping and unclasping the pole,
trying it cautiously. Against the
vertical piece that made her perch
like a cross, she teetered awkwardly
and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loretta,&rdquo; said the padre, in
some concern, &ldquo;hast anything in
thy craw? Well, gulp down a
stone and grind thy grist. What
one swallowest that must one
digest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bgap">The gravel crunched behind him.
He glanced back, to see Padre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>Anzar advancing, brown cowl
shading hollow eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 618px;">
<a id="illo5"><img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="618" height="400" alt="Another frown and he passed on"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="gap">Padre Alonzo colored guiltily.
"Tony must go to the shade,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The sun is hot to the
cooking-point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Padre Anzar paused a moment,
glowering up at Loretta. &ldquo;Then
may it singe the plumage of that
vixen,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She desecrates
our garden.&rdquo; Another frown,
and he passed on.</p>

<p>Padre Alonzo watched him out
of sight before he again addressed
the parrot. &ldquo;I fear thou must
mend thy ways, Loretta,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Here it is Christmas Day, and
yet Anzar has no good words for
thee. But see,&rdquo;&mdash;he held up a
plump hand, displaying one of Gabrielda&rsquo;s
sweet biscuits&mdash;&ldquo;riotous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>as thou art, I have remembered.
And now tell me, what hast thou
given Tony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As though in mute answer, the
parrot suddenly lowered her head
toward him, and he saw that over
the gray of her feathered face was
a splash of scarlet, as if a vivid
fuchsia petal had fallen there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loretta!&rdquo; he cried anxiously;
&ldquo;Loretta! thine eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted her head until her
beak pointed past the giant crucifix
and straight into the glaring
sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buenos días,&rdquo; he prompted
tenderly, alarmed now at her unusual
silence and the indifference
shown his offering; &ldquo;Loretta,
buenos días.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was settling herself upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>her cross-like perch as if for the
night. &ldquo;<i>A-aw, To-o-ny! To-o-ny!</i>&rdquo;
she returned with a little sleepy
croak; &ldquo;<i>buenas noches! buenas
noches!</i>&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
